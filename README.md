# WebMap
This is a little map application I made in a Python course by Ardit Sulce.
It showed me how I can make a web map, using a python add-on that I was introduced to called "Folium". 
As of now all it does is use some data from a few files to keep track of some geographic landmarks (in this one, volcanoes, specifically)
and the populations of the countries. 
It showed me my first glimpse of how to work with Python to make website applications. 
I'd like to give a warm thank you to Ardit for creating this course which guided me to make this and help me become knowledgable in Python.
Here is the link to the course for anyone interested: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-mega-course/
